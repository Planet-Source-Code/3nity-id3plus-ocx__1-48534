### Description

Here it is...

This is an ID3 Tag v1/v2 Reader / Writer and mp3/wav info viewer...

Yes i understand that it wuld be better to make a class but so it is easier to understand by begginers... And it is easy to put in a project...

Have fun... The code was picked from other authors as well, but (if not comented) i can't remember them... If anyone recognizes their code, let me know, so i will give u credits... Otherwise have fun...

Sory for my English...
